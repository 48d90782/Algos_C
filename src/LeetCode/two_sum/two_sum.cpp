//Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such
// that they add up to a specific target.
//
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
// and you may not use the same element twice.
//
//Example:
//
//Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
//
//        Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
//return [0, 1].

int main() {
    auto v = std::vector<int>{-3, 4, 3, 90};
    auto resint = 0;

    auto res = Solution{};
    auto rr = res.twoSum(v, resint);
    return 0;
}

// Brute force
std::vector<int> Solution::twoSum(std::vector<int> &nums, int target) {
    auto result = std::vector<int>{};
    for (std::vector<int>::size_type i = 0; i != nums.size(); i++) {
        for (std::vector<int>::size_type j = i + 1; j != nums.size(); j++) {
            if ((nums[i] + nums[j]) == target) {
                result.push_back(i);
                result.push_back(j);
                return result;
            }
        }
    }

//To improve our run time complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if
// the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to look up
// its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the
// array to its index? A hash table.
//
//We reduce the look up time from O(n)O(n) to O(1)O(1) by trading space for speed.
// A hash table is built exactly for this purpose,
// it supports fast look up in near constant time.
// I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a look up could degenerate to O(n)O(n) time.
// But look up in hash table should be amortized O(1)O(1) time as long as the hash function
// was chosen carefully.
//
//A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration,
// we add each element's value and its index to the table.
// Then, in the second iteration we check
// if each element's complement (target - nums[i]targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the table.
// Beware that the complement must not be nums[i]nums[i] itself!
